# Programming Daily Log

## 22-02-2025
In this log I will write down everything any thoughts I have in the process of learning code especifcally for game developpement.
Today, for example, I reopened Visual Studio for the first time in months, and I'm relearning how to take notes using GitHub to familiarize 
myself with the process and hopefully build a daily habit.
