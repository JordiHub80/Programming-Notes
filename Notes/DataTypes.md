# Data Types in Python

## Strings
A string refers to a string of characters. It is inititated by using quotation marks.

We can select individual components of a string using square brackets. 

### Subscripting
Subscripting is the method of pulling out one element of a string using square brackets and the number indicating the postion of the character on the string 

Ex. print("Hello"[0])

## Integers
An integer is a whole number. To declare an integer, just write it down without any marks.

Ex. print(5 + 5)

You can write down big numbers separated by underscores for easier understanding.

Ex. 134_546_258

## Float or Floating Point Number
Numbers with decimals in them.

Ex. print(3.1416)

## Boolean
It is a data type that can only be true or false.

Ex. print(True)
    print(False)

## Type checking 
We can verify the data type of a sequence by using the type( ) function.

Ex. print(type("Hello")) will tell us this is a string.

## Type Casting
You can change the type of a piece of data using the following functions.

str()
int()
float()
bool()
